## ✔️ Todo
- [ ] Lifer (the opposite of no-Lifer) - A mobile app that let's you score your life. (Create sections ("Social", "Spiritual", "Physical", ...) and give them the weights you want. On each section, add tasks that have to be completed daily (or weekly?) ("Call a friend", "Read one chapter from the bible", "Do 15 push-ups") and assign again the desired weights. At the end of each day, fill in a quick survey that stores your daily score and lets you know how successful your life is, according to your standards.
